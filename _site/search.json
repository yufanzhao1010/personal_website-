    "text": "Predicting NBA Game Outcomes Using Rolling Averages — UCLA\n\nEngineered team level rolling and weighted rolling averages across shooting, rebounding, assists, turnovers, and plus minus statistics to predict win loss outcomes using historical NBA game data.\n\nTrained and evaluated Random Forest and QDA classifiers using standard, weighted, and difference in rolling average features, achieving peak accuracy of 0.78 with weighted rolling averages.\n\nPerformed feature selection and forward selection on weighted rolling metrics and constructed opponent based difference features, confirming margin and efficiency statistics as the strongest predictors of game outcomes.\n\nPlease see my project here!"
